# Tomato Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning üçÖ

## Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model that predicts diseases affecting tomato crops. By leveraging image processing and classification algorithms, this model helps farmers identify and manage diseases effectively, ultimately reducing crop losses and improving food security.

## Project Highlights

- **Disease Categories**: The model predicts the following diseases:
  - Tomato Bacterial Spot
  - Tomato Early Blight
  - Tomato Late Blight
  - Tomato Leaf Mold
  - Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot
  - Tomato Spider Mites (Two-Spotted Spider Mites)
  - Tomato Target Spot
  - Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
  - Tomato Mosaic Virus
  - Tomato Healthy

## Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**: A comprehensive dataset of over 10,000 images of tomato plants was collected and labeled for various diseases.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and flipping were applied to enhance the model's performance.
   - **Normalization**: Pixel values were normalized to a range of 0 to 1.
   - **Dataset Splitting**: The dataset was divided into training (70%), validation (15%), and test sets (15%).

3. **Model Building**:
   - A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed and implemented.
   - Achieved an accuracy of 95% on the validation set.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Techniques like grid search and random search were used to optimize model parameters.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC curve were employed to assess model effectiveness.

6. **Deployment**: The model was deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and receive instant predictions.
